        <h1 style="padding-top: 5%">MAYAN BEGINNINGS</h1>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 5%">
          (Inspiration Stage, 15 ACE)<br />Although the Mayan Washaka (ネラマ)
          existed, the Mayans as a powerful entity only came into existence<br />during
          the Inspiration Stage of the universe.<br />The Mayans started out as
          a small army, ruled by the Washaka. They soon grew in size and power
          on the<br />opposite side of the universe, far away from the Forbidden
          One.
        </p>
        <h1>THE ZAIN</h1>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 5%">
          (Inspiration Stage, 145 ACE)<br />An internal conflict arose between
          the Restu and the Stadu of the Mayans, two similar but different
          groups in<br />Mayan culture.<br />Restu Mayans believed that divine
          supremacy (total control over the universe) lied inside the Forbidden
          One,<br />only obtainable with the use of brute force.<br />Stadu
          Mayans believed the Forbidden One was a distraction to their divine
          supremacy as univese leader,<br />claiming that if they focused on
          conquering one Land at a time they would eventually reach divine
          supremacy<br />without bloodshed.<br />This divide led to The Zain, a
          civil war between the two Mayan groups. The Restu Mayans ended up
          winning the war, but<br />not without consequences.
        </p>
        <h1>HENRE'S WRATH</h1>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 5%">
          For ages, the Mayans have been led by the fearless Washaka, a symbol
          of strength and bravery to many native Mayans who<br />
          lived during the first Reckoning.<br />

          The untold side of this well-known legend lies in the Goron society, a
          society that broke off from the Mayan empire long<br />
          before the Mayan Washaka was conceived.<br />

          Henre is the decendant of an elite Mayan family that has considerable
          wealth and power among the Mayans. Born a Goron,<br />
          few Mayans-- or for that matter, beings in general knew of his
          existence in this plane.<br />

          In an effort to make himself known, he travelled to the Mayan
          civilization and had a child. Henre had to sacrifice his<br />
          physical form to create his child, which explains his existence as a
          metaphysical eyeball.<br />

          His child, of course, is the Mayan Washaka.<br />

          He succeeded in getting well known around the Mayan empire, and his
          name was reportedly recorded and mentioned in many<br />
          works of literature during the early years of the Washaka.
          Unfortunately, many records and books written during this<br />
          time were either burned or lost in translation.<br />

          Henre, being an immortal being, became enraged with the Mayan legacy
          left behind for him. Most Mayans looked towards the<br />
          Mayan Washaka for guidance towards the Forbidden One, and they left
          behind the ideas that the Henre presented. Left with<br />
          a thirst for vengeance, he succeeded in overthrowing the Mayan
          government, and formed the Mayan Temple.
