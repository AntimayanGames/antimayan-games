          O Forbidden One, Whose name remains unknown,
          <br />We give our forgiveness and blessings to you.<br />
          The profecy states the Mayans will return to take the infinite power
          for themselves. We know if the Mayans<br />gain access to this holy
          power, the world as we know it will come to an end.<br />Please, O
          Forbidden One, gide us to safety when the day of doom is upon us.<br />Kevin
          Wallace taught us well, and his assignments due in The Classroom have
          prepared us for a war with the<br />Mayans.<br />

          (5000 C.E)
          <br />As the Forbidden One used his immense power against the Mayans
          during The Reckoning, he<br />
          became weak. His body was split into many parts during his fight the
          Mayan Washaka. This event,<br />know to many as the Woken Mark<br /><br />

          He fled to an unknown location, far from the Mayans to regain his
          great power.<br /><br />

          During the time he was gone, he trained a fleet of Forbidden Guards to
          protect his land. The<br />leader of these guards was Great Wallace.
